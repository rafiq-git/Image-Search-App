Title: Build an Image Search App with Unsplash API and JavaScript

Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to build an Image Search App using the Unsplash API and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for images based on their input and display the search results dynamically on the web page. We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the app.

Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, you'll need an access key from the Unsplash API, which you can obtain by creating an account on the Unsplash website.

Setting Up the HTML Structure
We start by setting up the basic HTML structure of our app. We have an h1 heading for the app title, a form element with an input field and a search button, a div with a class of search-results to hold the search results, and a "Show more" button.

Styling the App with CSS
Next, we apply some basic styles to our app using CSS. We import the Google Fonts library to use the Poppins font. We set up styles for the different elements such as the form, input field, search button, search results, and "Show more" button. The CSS is responsible for the layout, sizing, and visual appearance of the app.

JavaScript Functionality
Now comes the JavaScript part where we implement the functionality of the app. We start by declaring variables and constants to reference the necessary elements on the page. We also set up variables to keep track of the search query, the current page, and the access key for the Unsplash API.

Next, we define an asynchronous function called searchImage that handles the image search. Inside this function, we retrieve the search query from the input field, construct the API URL with the search query, page number, and access key, and send a request to the Unsplash API using the fetch function.

Once we receive the response from the API, we parse the JSON data and extract the search results. If it's the first page of the search, we clear the previous results from the search results container. Then, for each search result, we create HTML elements dynamically using createElement, set the necessary attributes and content, and append them to the search results container.

After processing the search results, we increment the page number and check if there are more pages available. If so, we display the "Show more" button; otherwise, we hide it.

We also set up event listeners for the form submission and "Show more" button clicks. When the form is submitted, we prevent the default form submission behavior, reset the page number to 1, and call the searchImage function. When the "Show more" button is clicked, we call the searchImage function to load more search results.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully built an Image Search App using the Unsplash API and JavaScript. Users can now search for images, and the app dynamically displays the search results. You can further enhance the app by adding features like pagination, filtering, or sorting options.

This project demonstrates how to interact with an API, handle asynchronous requests, and manipulate the DOM to create a responsive and interactive web application. You can use this knowledge as a foundation to build more advanced applications that integrate with various APIs and provide rich user experiences.

Remember to consider any rate limits or usage restrictions imposed by the API provider and ensure you comply with their terms of use when using their services.

Happy coding!
